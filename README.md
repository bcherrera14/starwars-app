## Summary

This application uses react, axios, and RESTful API conventions. Character data is pulled from the star wars API using axios and the response is formatted in a HTML table. This application uses state and life cycle methods to keep track of the data being displayed. The user can enter a search term and the results of the search term will be displayed. This gives the user the ability to look up any star wars character.
